# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-08-27)

**Core value:** Crosswake stays safe to change, inexpensive to verify, pleasant to review, and
ready to release without weakening Phoenix-first runtime contracts or honest support claims.
**Current focus:** Phase 164 — Dependency Security and Gate Authority

## Current Position

Phase: 164 of 168 (Dependency Security and Gate Authority)
Plan: Not planned
Status: Ready to discuss or plan
Last activity: 2026-08-28 — v22.0 roadmap created with 26/26 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 164-168 | 0 | 0 min | N/A |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase numbering continues at 164, but parked Phase 163.1 is not a dependency of this workstream.
- Dependency security and merge-gate authority must be trustworthy before CI optimization begins.
- CI optimization must preserve named proof evidence and fail-closed required aggregators.
- Android remains at its existing generator, Maven, JVM, and vector posture; no feature or parity
  expansion is authorized.
- Package and tag publication remains an irreversible maintainer approval; v22 automates reversible
  preparation and proves the exact 0.2.1 candidate.

### Pending Todos

None in this workstream yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No blocker to Phase 164 planning.
- The First B2C Adopter work remains parked separately at Phase 163.1 pending external route/device
  authority; do not copy or infer adopter facts into v22 artifacts.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Adopter activation | Plans 163.1-08 through 163.1-10 | Parked in separate workstream | v22 start | v21.0 |
| Future seed | Sigra hosted-session interoperability release (SEED-009) | Future | v22 scope | Future |
| Future seed | Reference-host presentation polish (SEED-010) | Dormant | v22 scope | Future |
